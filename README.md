# Teamwork API Reference 
(Unofficial)

The Reference consists of : 
- Swagger files of the Teamwork API (JSON and YAML)
- An excel file of methods and descriptions (really useful when you want to generate code or JSON using concat etc.)


## Swagger
Swagger is an open format for Designing, Building and Publishing REST APIs. [Swagger.io](http://swagger.io/) Website.

[Swaggerhub](http://swaggerhub.com) is also from the same team.

### [API documentation frontend](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/goddd/TeamWorkAPI/1.0.0)


There is a bunch of cool things you can do with swagger files.
### Get down and dirty with the API quickly
- Generate static documentation for the API with very specfic details including data types of each call and responses. 
- The static documentation also gives you the option to configure your credentials and make calls directly using your browser so you can get playing with the API in no time without having to write anything upfront. Because the expected variables are already available to you as simple forms there's no need to refer any other documentation. (The credentials are maintained on your browser using javascript).

### Generate client side code
- Because the URLs and datatypes are already defined as part of the swagger file you can generate client libraries for about 36 different languages and formats. (scala, android, objectivec, swift, angular ... etc) 

### Use the swagger eco-system
- There is a world of integrations, tools and front-end options around swagger that can be leveraged.
